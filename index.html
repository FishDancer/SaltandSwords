      <p><h1><span>Abjuration Discipline</span></h1></p>
      <p><span>Abjuration spells are basically all protection spells. A high proficiency bonus is not required, making Abjuration an excellent secondary or tertiary discipline.</span></p>
 
        
      <h3 id="abj0"><span>Cantrips</span></h3>
      <p><span><strong>Shield</strong></span><span>: 1 action, +1 circumstance bonus to AC, +1 circumstance bonus to toughness till your next turn. You also can use the Shield Block reaction until your next turn, which gives you +2 toughness vs 1 attack.</span></p>
<br>
      <p><span><strong>Resistance</strong></span><span>: 1 action. 30&rsquo; range, single target. Target gets a +1 status bonus to the next saving throw it makes durning the next minute.</span></p>

      <h3 id="abj1"><span>1 focus point spells</span></h3>

      <p><span><strong>Poison Resistance</strong></span><span>: 2 actions. Touch range, single target. Target creature becomes resistant 2 to poison damage and has advantage on saving throws against poisons for the next 10 minutes.</span></p>
<br>
      <p><span><strong>Warding Bond</strong></span><span>: 1 action. Choose 1 creature within 120&rsquo; to be the aggressor and 1 creature within 120&rsquo; to be the defender. The aggressor makes a Will save. </span><span>Critical Success</span><span>&nbsp;the spell has no effect. </span><span>Success</span><span>&nbsp;the spell makes the defender resistant 1 to the aggressor&rsquo;s attacks for 1 minute. </span><span>Failure</span><span>&nbsp;the spell makes the defender resistant 2 to the aggressor&rsquo;s attacks for 1 minute. </span><span>Critical Failure</span><span>&nbsp;the spell makes the defender resistant 3 to the aggressor&rsquo;s attacks for 1 minute. The attacker is aware that this spell made it harder for them to hurt the defender.</span></p>
     
      <h3 id="abj2"><span>2 focus point spells</span></h3>
      <p><span><strong>Magnetic Repulsion</strong></span><span>: 1 action. You gain a +1 status bonus to AC vs weapons with metal cutting edges for the next 10 minutes. Such weapons include swords, axes, spears, arrows... But it doesn't include clubs, rocks, darts, whips&hellip;</span></p>
<br>
      <p><span><strong>Wall of Wind</strong></span><span>: 2 actions. Conjure a wall of whistling wind that lasts for 1 hour or until you dispel it as an action. Choose 6 consecutive 5&rsquo; wide by 5&rsquo; long by 10&rsquo; tall panels all wholly within 60&rsquo; or 1 10&rsquo;-5&rsquo; radius half torus (so a big 10&rsquo; radius hemisphere with a small 5&rsquo; radius hemisphere cut out of the center) also wholly within 60&rsquo;. The chosen volume is filled with gale-force wind. And projectiles that pass through the volume have disadvantage to hit. Any creature passing through the volume moves at &frac14; speed.</span></p>
   
      <h3 id="abj3"><span>3 focus point spells</span></h3>
      <p><span><strong>Energy Resistance</strong></span><span>: 2 actions. Touch range, single target. Target creature becomes </span><span>resistant 3 to</span><span>&nbsp;Acid, Cold, Electric, Fire, and Sonic damage for 10 minutes.</span></p>

      <p><span><strong>Missile Mirror</strong></span><span>: 2 actions. Touch range, single target. For the next minute the target is surrounded by a shimmering magical barrier that deflects ranged attacks. All ranged attacks made against this shielded creature have disadvantage. Also ranged attacks that critically miss are rebounded onto the original attacker. These re-bound attacks use your protection spell attack modifier</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>for the attack roll and deal the same damage as the original attack.</span></p>
    
      <h3 id="abj5"><span>5 focus point spells</span></h3>
      <p><span><strong>Wall of Force</strong></span><span>: 2 actions. Conjure a wall of impenetrable force that lasts for 1 hour or until you dispel it as an action.

A creature that would be encircled or trapped by this gets a reflex save to move to the other side of the wall and not be trapped. The chosen volume is filled with an impenetrable, invisible magical barrier. Nothing except light can go through the barrier. This includes air, so a hemisphere could suffocate the creatures inside if there are a lot of creatures inside.</span></p>
  
      <h3 id="abj6"><span>6 focus point spells</span></h3>
      <p><span><strong>Death Ward</strong></span><span>: 3 actions. Touch range, single target. The next time during the next hour the target creature is reduced to 0 wounds they go to 1 wound instead.</span></p>

All 6 prison guards leaving their posts to have a shit at the same time is DC 20. Suddenly inheriting a fortune from your second cousin's twice removed aunt because her and like 50 of her extended relatives all died in the same tragic accident, making you her closest living relative is DC 30. Finding out that you already own that one unique and impossible to find magic artifact that you needed to find, and had actually been using it as a fashion piece for years without ever thinking it was even magical at all is DC 40.</span></p>

      <h3 id="forc4"><span>4 focus point spells</span></h3>
      <p><span><strong>Force Crush</strong></span><span>: 2 actions. 30' range, single target. Summon invisible bands of force to restrain and slowly crush the target. Target creature takes 2D6 Force damage and becomes Grappled. For as long as they remain Grappled they take 2D6 Force damage at the end of their turns. They can spend 1 action to try and escape by making an Athletics or Acrobatics check vs your spellcasting DC. Each time they try to escape they take 2D6 Force damage as the bands tighten.</span></p>
      <h3 id="forc5"><span>5 focus point spells</span></h3>
      <p><span><strong>Blade Barrier</strong></span><span>: 2 actions. Touch range, single target. Target creature is surrounded in a magical force field that protects against weapons. They gain Resistance 3 to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage. This effect lasts for 10 minutes.</span></p>
      <h3 id="forc6"><span>6 focus point spells</span></h3>
      <p><span><strong>Force Choke</strong></span><span>: 1 action. 30' range, single target. Target creature can't breathe and becomes Choking 1. On each of your subsequent turns you must spend 1 action to continue the choke or else the spell ends. To do so you need to be within 30' of the target. When you do so the target makes a Fortitude save, increasing their Choking stage by 1 on a failure or by 2 on a critical failure, and reducing it by 1 on a critical success. Their save counts as being 1 degree of success better if they spent 1 action gasping for air on their last turn and 1 degree of success worse if they spoke any words (normally one must speak to cast spells) on their last turn. This spell ends if their Choking value ever becomes 0, or a maximum of 10 minutes.</span></p>
      <h3 id="forc7"><span>7 focus point spells</span></h3>
      <p><span><strong>Force Cage</strong></span><span>: 2 actions. 30' range, single target. You try to trap the target creature in a cage made of pure magical force. You choose either a large, normal or small cage. Then the creature makes a reflex save. They have </span><span>disadvantage</span><span>&nbsp;if you choose a large cage and advantage if you choose a small cage. If they fail they become trapped in the cage. If they succeed they escape just before the cage is complete, but take 4D8 Force damage as part of the cage wall crushes them during their escape. If they critically succeed they fully escape with no damage. Once trapped inside it is impossible to enter or leave the cage. There are gaps in the cage so air and projectiles can pass through, and the cage bars are invisible. A small cage is so small the trapped creature is also Grappled. A medium cage lets the creature move 5' in every direction. A large cage lets the creature move 15' in every direction. Regardless, the trapped creature treats all their Reflex saving throws as 1 degree of success worse. The cage lasts for 24 hours or until you dismiss it as a 1 action activity.</span></p>

      <p><span><strong>Telekinesis</strong></span><span>: 3 actions. Self. You unleash your true power, able to move objects at will. This spell lasts for 10 minutes, or until you end it as a 1 action activity. While this spell is active you gain the following actions:</span></p>
      <p><span></span><span><strong>Telekinetic Projectile</strong></span><span>: 1 action. Fling 1 unattended object of 1 bulk or less at a creature. Make an attack roll for 1D8+MOD Bludgeoning damage. This works like a weapon attack with range 60'.</span></p>
      <p><span></span><span><strong>Telekinetic Movement</strong></span><span>: 1 action. Move 1 object of 50 or less bulk within 60' or 1 creature within 60' up to 20' in any direction. It can fly during this movement, and the movement is too slow to harm anyone. The object/creature begins to fall at the end of this movement, or at the start of your next turn if you spend all 3 actions moving it. An unwilling creature gets to make a reflex save to avoid this unwanted movement.</span></p>
      <p><span></span><span><strong>Telekinetic Grip</strong></span><span>: 1 action. Choose 1 creature within 60'. They become Grappled until the start of your next turn.

      <h3 id="fort4"><span>4 focus point spells</span></h3>
      <p><span><strong>Charitable Urge</strong></span><span>: 2 actions, 30' range, 1 creature. Target creature makes a Will save. </span><span>Critical success</span><span>: they are unaffected. </span><span>Success</span><span>: they become stunned 1 from being confused, both wanting to give away their possessions and not at the same time. </span><span>Failure</span><span>: they become overwhelmed with a need to give away their most valued possession. On their next turn they spend 2 actions giving their most valuable thing on their person to the poorest creature they can get to with their 2 actions. </span><span>Critical Failure</span><span>: same as failure, except they spend all 3 of their actions instead of just 2.</span></p>
      <h3 id="fort5"><span>5 focus point spells</span></h3>
      <p><span><strong>Blur</strong></span><span>: 3 actions, Touch range, 1 creature. Target creature gains +1 status bonus to AC and reflex saves as well as a +10' status bonus to speed for the next minute.</span></p>

If you choose a creature other than yourself as the target, you create a psychic link through which you can inform the target of danger. While </span><span>foresight</span><span>&nbsp;is in effect, the target gains a +2 status bonus to initiative rolls and isn't flat-footed against undetected creatures or when flanked. In addition, you gain the following reaction: </span><span>Forewarn</span><span>. 1 reaction when the target of foresight is targeted by an attack or is forced to make a saving throw, but before any dice are rolled.

      <h3 id="fort8"><span>8 focus point spells</span></h3>
      <p><span><strong>Fated Confrontation</strong></span><span>: 2 actions. 2 target creatures within 120' (don't have to be visible) You weave the threads of fate to lead two foes into a climactic battle. The targets of this spell are the fated opponents: one of the targets of this spell must be you or a willing ally, and the other must be an enemy.</span></p>
      <br>
      <p><span>When you Cast the Spell, the ally you targeted (or you, if you targeted yourself) may teleport to any unoccupied space of their choice within 30' of its fated opponent.</span></p>
      <br>
      <p><span>You isolate the two targets for 1 minute. During this time, fate refuses to allow either fated opponent to be affected by attacks or effects from a third party; a fated opponent could be affected by the other's Fireball or its own Heal spell, but it would be entirely immune to a spell or Strike from a creature outside of the spells effects, as well including damage from a hazard or the environment. This doesn't apply to anything that was affecting the targets before you cast </span><span>fated confrontation</span><span>&nbsp;(such as a spell with a duration or persistent damage the creature had before it was affected by </span><span>fated confrontation</span><span>), and fated combatants can still attack other creatures.</span></p>
      <br>
      <p><span>This spell ends after 1 minute, if either target is unable to take a hostile action against the other, or if they both agree to cease hostilities.</span></p>
     
        
        
        
        <a id="illu"></a>
        <p><h1><span>Illusion Discipline</span></h1></p>
      <p><span>Illusion spells are very useful out of combat and are really only limited by your imagination. They are far less useful in combat</span></p>
   
      <h3 id="illu0"><span>Cantrips</span></h3>
      <p><span><strong>Minor Illusion</strong></span><span>: 2 actions. Make a stationary silent illusion that fits inside a 10' cube anywhere within 30'. The illusion lasts for 1D6 hours (the DM rolls this secretly). A creature can attempt a perception check vs your Spell DC to see through the illusion.</span></p>
<br>
      <p><span><strong>Color Spray</strong></span><span>: 2 actions. 15' cone, reflex save. Any creatures that fail are coated in magic multicolored glowing paint. They shed bright light in a 5' radius and dim light in a further 5' radius. They also cannot benefit from the Hidden condition. This effect lasts for 10 minutes.</span></p>
      <h3 id="illu1"><span>1 focus point spells</span></h3>
      <p><span><strong>Disguise</strong></span><span>: 3 actions. Touch range, single willing target. Create an illusory disguise for the target creature. The disguise can make them look like any other creature, but can't change their apparent weight or height by more than 10%. The disguise lasts for 1D6 hours (the DM should roll this secretly and will let you know when your disguise starts to fade). Creatures can attempt a perception check vs your Spell DC to see through the disguise.</span></p>
<br>
      <p><span><strong>Invisibility</strong></span><span>: 3 actions. You become invisible (which mechanically means all other creatures are Blind against you) for 10 minutes or until you make an attack or cast a spell.</span></p>
      <h3 id="illu2"><span>2 focus point spells</span></h3>
      <p><span><strong>Group Invisibility</strong></span><span>: 3 actions. You and any creature within 5' of you when you cast this spell become invisible. This functions exactly the same as the regular invisibility spell: a creature becomes invisible (which mechanically means all other creatures are blind against you) for 10 minutes or until they make an attack or cast a spell.</span></p>
<br>
      <p><span><strong>Worm's Repast</strong></span><span>: 2 actions, 30' range, single target. The target makes a Will save as illusory worms appear and begin consuming its flesh, complete with grotesque munching noises. </span><span>Critical Success:</span><span>&nbsp;the spell has no effect. </span></p>
      <p><span>Success:</span><span>&nbsp;the target becomes frightened 1 and stunned 1. </span></p>
      <p><span>Fail:</span><span>&nbsp;the target becomes frightened 2 and stunned 2. </span></p>
      <p><span>Critical Fail:</span><span>&nbsp;the target becomes frightened 3 and stunned 3.</span></p>
      <h3 id="illu3"><span>3 focus point spells</span></h3>
      <p><span><strong>Mirror Image</strong></span><span>: 1 action. Touch range, single target. Create an illusory duplicate of the target that follows the target around mimicking their actions. When an attack is made against the target there is a 50% chance the attack is made against the illusory duplicate (which is immune to all damage being an illusion). Each time the illusion is hit the chance of it being hit again goes down by 10%. A creature can use 1 action to make a Perception check vs your spell DC to recognise the real version. If they Succeed they recognize the illusion and can target the real creature with their attacks, essentially negating the effects of this spell on them. They can also point out the illusion to any number of creatures within 30' of them as an action, halving the chance they target the illusion and granting them advantage on any perception checks to identify the illusion. If they Critically Succeeded instead the spell ends when they point out the illusion. If they Critically Fail they have Disadvantage on all future attempts to identify the illusion. The illusion disappears after 1 minute.</span></p>
      <h3 id="illu4"><span>4 focus point spells</span></h3>
      <p><span><strong>Heart's Desire</strong></span><span>: 3 actions. 120' range, single target. Create an illusion of a creature's deepest desire that appears at a point of your choosing within 120' that is also within 120' of the target. The target creature makes a Will save:</span></p>
      <p><span>Critical Success: unaffected.</span></p>
      <p><span>Success: Enthralled by the illusion for 1 minute or until they realize it is an illusion (which requires a successful Perception check vs your spell DC).</span></p>
      <p><span>Failure: Enthralled by the illusion for 1 minute or until they realize it is an illusion (which requires a successful Perception check vs your spell DC). Additionally the creature must spend its first 2 actions on each of its turns to Stride closer to the illusion.</span></p>
      <p><span>Critical Failure: Enthralled by the illusion for 10 minutes or until they realize it is an illusion (which requires a successful Perception check vs your spell DC). Additionally the creature must spend its first 2 actions on each of its turns to Stride closer to the illusion.</span></p>
      <h3 id="illu5"><span>5 focus point spells</span></h3>
      <p><span><strong>Hallucinatory Terrain</strong></span><span>: 3 actions. 500' range, 250' cube. Create a powerful illusion that covers the ground, trees, buildings, and even creatures in the area. The illusion can be anything but lacks minute detail and won't hold up to close examination. The illusion is also stationary and makes no sound. You can choose not to include any parts of the cube in the illusion and just leave them looking like they normally do. A creature can see through the illusion by succeeding on a Perception check vs your spell DC. They have Advantage on the check if they are within 30' of the illusion.</span></p>
      <h3 id="illu6"><span>6 focus point spells</span></h3>
      <p><span><strong>Doppelganger</strong></span><span>: 3 actions. Touch range, single target. Create an illusory duplicate of the target creature. The duplicate will pretend to perform any tasks you ask of it (remember it is an illusion and can't affect any physical objects). It can speak and uses your spellcasting attack modifier for its Deception, Diplomacy, Intimidation, and Performance checks. A creature can see through the illusion by succeeding on a Perception check vs your spell DC. They have disadvantage on the check unless they have some reason to be suspicious of the Doppleganger.</span></p>
      <h3 id="illu7"><span>7 focus point spells</span></h3>
      <p><span><strong>Hallucination</strong></span><span>: 3 actions. 60' range, single target. Will save.</span></p>
      <p><span>Critical Success: unaffected.</span></p>
      <p><span>Success: the target sees the occasional hallucination. For the next minute, at the start of its turns it makes a Perception check to figure out what is real and what is hallucination. If it succeeds it acts normally. If it fails it acts as if the hallucinations are real. You decide what they are and can spend 1 action to alter them. If any hallucination is particularly unbelievable the target gets to make another Will save, ending the effect on a critical success.</span></p>
      <p><span>Failure: the target is hallucinating. For the next minute the target believes the hallucinations are real. You decide what they are and can spend 1 action to alter them. If any hallucination is particularly unbelievable the target gets to make another Will save, moving to the Success effect of this spell on a success and ending the effect on a critical success.</span></p>
      <p><span>Critical Failure: same as Failure except the duration is 10 minutes and the target never gets to make additional saves.</span></p>
      <h3 id="illu8"><span>8 focus point spells</span></h3>
      <p><span><strong>Weird</strong></span><span>: 3 actions. Any number of creatures within 120'. You fill the targets' minds with terrifying images of fearsome creatures, each drawn from the targets' worst fears. Only the targets can see their assailants. Each target makes a basic Will save vs 10D6 mental damage. If they </span><span>succeed</span><span>&nbsp;they are also frightened 1. If they </span><span>fail</span><span>&nbsp;they are frightened 2. If they </span><span>critically fail</span><span>&nbsp;they are so afraid, they might instantly die. It must attempt a Fortitude saving throw. If they succeed, they take quadrupole damage (as opposed to the normal double damage) and are frightened 2.. If they fail, they are reduced to 0 Hit Points and die.</span></p>

      <p><span><strong>Tornado</strong></span><span>: 2 actions. 120' range, 30' radius, 100' high cylinder. The cylinder is filled with a mighty tornado.

Any creature that starts its turn inside the tornado (but not in the eye), enters the tornado, or takes any movement actions while inside the tornado must make a Reflex save or Athletics check (their choice) or be swept up into the eye of the tornado. A creature taking a movement action can take time to brace themselves to get advantage on their save, but they take a -10' speed penalty for doing so. A creature in the eye of the tornado is in the center of the cylinder, is grappled, and takes 4D8 Bludgeoning damage at the end of their turn. A creature in the eye of the tornado is released from the grapple at the start of their turn, presumably falling 50' to the ground. The tornado lasts for 10 minutes or until you dismiss it as a 1 action activity.</span></p>

<p><h1><span>Sonic Discipline</span></h1></p>
      <p><span>This is a mixed Discipline with a fairly even distribution of combat and non-combat spells</span></p>
    
      <h3 id="soni0"><span>Cantrips</span></h3>
      <p><span><strong>Amplify</strong></span><span>: 3 actions. For 1 minute make your voice 9 times louder, which means it travels 3 times as far.</span></p>
<br>
      <p><span><strong>Ghost Sound</strong></span><span>: 1 action. Make a short sound originating from a location of your choice within 120'.</span></p>
      <h3 id="soni1"><span>1 focus point spells</span></h3>
      <p><span><strong>Thunderwave</strong></span><span>: 1 action. 10' burst centered on caster, basic fortitude save vs 2D6 sonic damage. Caster is immune. Any Large or smaller creature that fails the save is also pushed away 5', or 10' if they critically fail.</span></p>
<br>
      <p><span><strong>Detection</strong></span><span>: 3 actions. Make even the faintest of sounds detectable to your discerning ear. Make a perception check to try and listen to your surroundings. Your check counts as 1 level of success higher than what you rolled. So a </span><span>success becomes a critical success ect.</span></p>
      <h3 id="soni2"><span>2 focus point spells</span></h3>
      <p><span><strong>Shatter</strong></span><span>: 2 actions, 10' sphere centered on a point within 60'. Basic fortitude save vs 3D8 sonic damage. Objects, buildings, and vehicles automatically critically fail their saves.</span></p>
<br>
      <p><span><strong>Muffle</strong></span><span>: 3 actions. Choose an adjacent creature or object. If they are unwilling they must make a Will save or be affected. For the next 10 minutes the target is muffled, meaning all noise they make is completely suppressed. Effectively this makes every other creature Deaf to noise made by the muffled creature. When you cast this spell you get to decide if this muffles their speech as well.</span></p>
      <h3 id="soni3"><span>3 focus point spells</span></h3>
      <p><span><strong>Sonic Pulse</strong></span><span>: 2 actions, 60' range, single target. Basic fortitude save vs 6D6 sonic damage.</span></p>

It can be heard outside the area, but only affects creatures in the area. While inside the area creatures are Deaf and if they cast any spells they must make a spell casting check vs your spell DC or the words of their spell are lost to the Crescendo and their spell fails (meaning they spend the actions and focus points to cast it, but it does nothing).</span></p>
      <h3 id="soni5"><span>5 focus point spells</span></h3>
      <p><span><strong>Resonance</strong></span><span>: 3 actions. Melee range, 1 object, structure, or vehicle. You find the resonance frequency of the object and then emit a sonic blast at the perfect frequency to destroy it. The target takes 150 sonic damage. This should be pretty devastating, destroying basically any non-magic wall or object and causing severe damage to vehicles. </span></p>
      <h3 id="soni6"><span>6 focus point spells</span></h3>
      <p><span><strong>Control Voice</strong></span><span>: 3 actions, 60' range, single target. For the next minute you alter the sounds the target makes to whatever you want. For example you can change the target's words, or make them seem silent. A skilled lip reader might notice a discrepancy, and of course the target will notice. The target can still try and cast spells, but they have to succeed on a spellcasting check vs your spell DC or their spell is lost.</span></p>
      <h3 id="soni7"><span>7 focus point spells</span></h3>
      <p><span><strong>Sonic Wave</strong></span><span>: 3 actions, 60' cone. All creatures in the cone make a basic fortitude save vs 12D6 sonic damage.</span></p>
      <h3 id="soni8"><span>8 focus point spells</span></h3>
      <p><span><strong>Danse Macabre</strong></span><span>: 3 actions, 30' sphere centered on a point within 120'. You conjure a haunting melody that worms its way into the minds of creatures and forces them to dance to the music. The melody persists for 1 minute. Whenever a creature starts its turn in the area it must make a Will save. If it </span><span>critically succeeds</span><span>&nbsp;it is unaffected. If it </span><span>succeeds</span><span>&nbsp;it spends 1 action dancing. If it </span><span>fails</span><span>&nbsp;it spends its entire turn dancing. If it </span><span>critically fails</span><span>&nbsp;it falls into a hopeless trance, doomed to dance until it drops dead from exhaustion.</span></p>

Melee range, single target, fortitude save. </span><span>Critical success</span><span>: the target is unaffected. </span><span>Success</span><span>: the target becomes Slowed 1 for 1 minute as their flesh briefly hardens. </span><span>Failure</span><span>: the target becomes Slowed 2 for 1 minute as their flesh hardens. </span><span>Critical Failure</span><span>: the creature's flesh turns to stone and they become petrified. They are not dead, merely suspended in stone until this spell is dispelled. They cannot move, speak, see, or otherwise interact or do anything while petrified. If their stone body is damaged that damage will remain if this spell is dispelled.</span></p>
      <h3 id="tran8"><span>8 focus point spells</span></h3>
      <p><span><strong>True Polymorph</strong></span><span>: 3 actions. Polymorph a creature into another creature of the same or lower tier. They lose all their abilities and stats, but gain all the abilities and stats of their new form. Unwilling creatures get a Will save to resist the effects. A polymorphed creature reduced to 0 wounds doesn't revert to their normal form; instead they follow normal Dying rules for their new form. This transformation lasts until dispelled by you as an action or is counteracted. True Polymorph also attempts to Counteract any other spells or effects altering a creature's form. If the counteract fails then the creature returns to its altered form if true polymorph ends.</span></p>
       
        
        
        

     
      <h1 id="rit"><span>Rituals</span></h1>
      <p><span>Rituals have some DC. When casting a ritual you need to make the listed checks and beat the listed DCs (arcana most used skill for arcane rituals). If any of the checks are failed the ritual fails and the components are wasted. Critically failing these checks can also have other worse effects. Some rituals require multiple casters, known as assistants, who make additional checks which and must pass their checks to succeed at being assistants.</span></p>
<br>
      <p><span>If a ritual ever causes a creature to make a saving throw, the DC of the save is the highest among the caster's DCs for all skills used to cast the ritual.</span></p>
      <h3 id="rittrain"><span>Trained</span></h3>
      <p><span>Tier 1 rituals are almost automatic and have very few, if any, material components</span></p>
<br>
      <p><span><strong>Mage Hand</strong></span><span>: 10 minute ritual. 1 S cost. 1 DC 16 Arcana check. Summon a floating hand made of pure force. It is visible as a spectral floating hand.

The servant disappears when reduced to 0 wounds or you create another servant.</span></p>

      <h3 id="ritexp"><span>Expert</span></h3>
      <p><span>Slightly harder rituals that normally have some costly material components.</span></p>
<br>
      <p><span><strong>Translate</strong></span><span>: 1 hour ritual. Enough ink and paper to write down the translated message. 1 DC 16 Arcana check and 1 DC 16 Society check. Perfectly translate up to 2,000 words of text in any language and transcribe it into any other language. You don't have to speak either language (the original language and the language to translate to), but for each of the 2 languages you speak, reduce the DC of both checks by 2.</span></p>
<br>
      <p><span><strong>Speak with Dead</strong></span><span>: 1 hour ritual. No cost. 1 DC 18 spellcasting check. Designate 1 corpse with a functioning mouth.

<br>
      <p><span><strong>Bestial Curse</strong></span><span>: 1 hour ritual. A piece of an animal. 1 DC 16 spellcasting check. You imbue the animal component of the ritual with a curse that partially transforms whoever touches it into that animal. Here &ldquo;animal&rdquo; refers to any creature made of living flesh that has no innate magical abilities. Cat, Shark, Human, Owlbear count. Tree, Golem, Demon, Dragon, do not. Anyone who touches the cursed animal body part must make a fortitude save. </span><span>Critical Success</span><span>: they are unaffected by the curse. They can touch the body part as often as they like to no ill effect. </span><span>Success</span><span>: They are partially affected. Their body changes slightly as it tries to transform. The changes are relatively minor, but they do become clumsy 1 for 2 weeks as they adjust to the subtle changes. The changes are permanent. </span><span>Failure</span><span>: They are affected. The results are </span><span>as success</span><span>, but the changes are slightly more drastic and they are Clumsy 2 for 2 weeks and Clumsy 1 for an additional 2 weeks after. </span><span>Critical failure</span><span>: They succumb to the curse, transforming into a rough copy of the animal whose body part it is. Their base physical stats (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Toughness, and Speed) change in relation to the base physical stats for the animal, and they gain any natural abilities of the animal (e.g. a flying speed for a bird, a </span><span>jaws</span><span>&nbsp;attack for a wolf&hellip;). They also lose any abilities inherent to their previous form (race abilities, opposable thumbs, ability to speak words&hellip;). They retain their intelligence, personality, memories, tier, and mental statistics. They also are Clumsy 2 for 2 weeks and Clumsy 1 for an additional 2 weeks after.</span></p>
<br>
      <p><span><strong>Glyph of Warding</strong></span><span>: 1 hour ritual. 4 G cost. 1 DC 15 spellcasting check. Designate a door or up to 6 consecutive 5'*5' squares.

<br>
      <p><span><strong>Darkvision</strong></span><span>: 1 hour. No cost. 1 DC 15 spellcasting check. 1 creature gains the Darkvision ability for the next 8 hours.</span></p>
<br>
      <p><span><strong>Magic Circle</strong></span><span>: 1 hour ritual. 6 G cost. 1 DC 18 spellcasting check. Designate a 10' or less radius circle that you trace on the floor. Also choose a creature type. Creatures of the chosen type cannot cross the line of the magic circle; they are prevented by an impenetrable invisible barrier that doesn't do anything to other creatures.</span></p>
<br>
      <p><span><strong>Revivify</strong></span><span>: 1 hour ritual. 5 G cost. 1 DC 20 Arcana or Religious Lore check. 1 creature who died in the last 24 hours and whose soul is free and willing is brought back to life on 1 wound. This does not heal any bodily ailments, so they will probably die again without healing.</span></p>
<br>
      <p><span><strong>Sending</strong></span><span>: 10 minute ritual. 1 G cost. 1 DC 18 Arcana check. Can have 1 assistant, who speaks the message to be sent. Send a message (less than a minute of you or your assistant speaking) to a creature. You have to have met the creature receiving the message or know their true name (just their actual full name, not any nickname or false name). The receiving creature must be on the same plane of existence.</span></p>
<br>
      <p><span><strong>Plant Growth</strong></span><span>: 4 hour ritual. 8 G cost. 1 DC 16 Arcana check and 1 DC 16 Nature check. You invigorate tha plants, making them grow stronger and faster.

<br>
      <p><span><strong>Consecrate</strong></span><span>: 1 hour ritual. 12 G cost. 1 DC 20 Arcana check or 1 DC 20 Religious Lore check. You consecrate an area to a certain being or deity, allowing them greater influence over the area. The area can be no more than a 101' radius sphere, but you can choose any smaller area. Most deities choose to invigorate their worshipers while they are on consecrated grounds and forbid their sworn enemies from entering their consecrated grounds.</span></p>
<br>
      <p><span><strong>Desecrate</strong></span><span>: 1 hour ritual. 12 G cost. 1 DC 20 Arcana check or 1 DC 20 Religious Lore check. You desecrate an area, purging all influence a deity/being had over the area (such as a Consecrated area). The deity/being no longer has any special attachment to the area and will be unable to influence it in the way they used to. This does nothing if the area has no deific influence.</span></p>
<br>
      <p><span><strong>Augury</strong></span><span>: 1 hour ritual. 6 G cost. 1 DC 18 Arcana/religious lore check. Contact a powerful being such as a deity and ask them a yes or no question. They will respond with yes, no, or unclear. It's advised to choose a nice being who won't take pleasure in blatantly lying or purposefully misleading you.</span></p>
<br>
      <p><span><strong>Water Walk</strong></span><span>: 1 hour ritual. X G cost. 1 DC 20 Arcana check. Up to X target creatures can walk on water as if it were extremely thick and sticky mud for the next 4 hours. It counts as Difficult terrain.</span></p>
<br>
      <h3 id="ritmas"><span>Master</span></h3>
      <p><span>These are pretty difficult rituals, often requiring 2 checks and a respectable investment in material components.</span></p>
<br>
      <p><span><strong>Commune with Nature</strong></span><span>: 4 hour ritual. No cost. 1 DC 22 Nature check and 1 DC 22 Arcana check. For the next 24 hours you can communicate with all natural living things within 1 mile of the casting site. So you can talk to plants and animals, they will understand you, and you will understand their responses.</span></p>
<br>
      <p><span><strong>Magic Mailbox</strong></span><span>: 4 hour ritual. 16 G cost plus 2 small containers. 2 DC 20 Arcana checks. The 2 containers provided for components are now linked. Any object placed in one is transported instantly to the other, and vice versa.</span></p>
<br>
      <p><span><strong>Magic Weapon</strong></span><span>: 1 hour ritual. 18 G cost. 2 DC 22 Arcana checks. 1 NON-magic weapon you touch during the ritual becomes magic. It has a +1 item bonus to hit and a +1 item bonus to damage. It loses 2 rune slots as this enchantment is not compatible with runes.</span></p>
<br>
      <p><span><strong>Planar Message</strong></span><span>: 1 hour ritual. No cost. 2 DC 19 Arcana checks. Choose a creature you know, or speak a creature's true name. Then speak a short message (less than 1 minute long). The chosen creature receives the message telepathically, regardless of the intervening distance or being on different planes. The target can also respond with a short message.</span></p>
<br>
      <p><span><strong>Create Undead</strong></span><span>: 4 hour ritual. 12 G cost. 2 DC 22 Arcana checks. When you cast this ritual you can choose to pay half the casting cost for -1 point, double the casting cost for +1 point, +5 DC for +1 point, -5 DC for -1 point. Choose a corpse. You also get +1 point for each tier the corpse was (+1 for tier 1 creature, +3 for tier 3) and +1 point for each tier you are. That corpse becomes animated as either a Skeleton or Zombie depending on its level of decay. At base it is tier 0, but you can spend 2 points to make it tier 1, 5 points to make it tier 2, or 8 points to make it tier 3. At base it is a dependent minion under your control, which means it follows your commands to the best of its ability (note undead tend to be rather stupid so it might misunderstand complicated commands). You can spend 1 point to make it an independent minion instead. Note undead have terrible memories so they will forget their commands pretty quickly (it is good practice to give undead new orders every 24 hours). You can spend 1 point to make it have a good memory, meaning it will never forget your commands. The corpse animated by this ritual retains some of its physical stats and abilities from when it was alive, but no magical abilities. So an animated rat will have the physical stats of a rat. An animated humanoid will have the physical stats of that humanoid. An animated griffin will have the physical stats of a griffin, and will likely be able to fly.</span></p>
<br>
      <p><span><strong>Cup of Dust</strong></span><span>: 6 hour ritual. 20 G cost, and 1 cup, tankard, goblet, or other drinking vessel. 2 DC 21 Arcana or Occult Lore checks. The cup used for the material component becomes terribly cursed. Any amount of liquid ingested from the cup dehydrates the drinker just as much as it would have hydrated from drinking pure water. Note this does not change the liquid in any way; so it will taste the same and have all the same properties. It can also be removed from the cup and drunk from another vessel and will then hydrate as normal. Furthermore because of how dehydration works any amount drunk from the cup will normally make the drinker Fatigued. And if a creature only drinks from the cup their maximum number of wounds is reduced by 1 for each day they continue to drink from the cup. A creature whose maximum </span><span>wounds</span><span>&nbsp;is ever 0 instantly dies.</span></p>
<br>
      <p><span><strong>Telepathic Link</strong></span><span>: 2 hour ritual. No cost. 2 DC 19 Arcana checks. At the end of the ritual touch a creature. For the next 24 hours you and that creature are telepathically linked. This means you can converse with each other silently and across vast distances.</span></p>
<br>
      <p><span><strong>Teleportation Circle</strong></span><span>: 1 hour ritual. 12 G. 2 DC 22 Arcana checks. Half cost if leaving from an already made permanent teleportation circle. At the end of the ritual you and any creatures or objects inside the circle you draw during this ritual are teleported to a permanent teleportation circle who's identifying code you know. Teleportation circles are normally quite fancy, but you can make a basic one with its own unique identifying code by performing this ritual and not teleporting anything. Making a circle with the same code as an already existing one is a serious problem as now anyone traveling to either circle goes to a random circle. Hence mages are very reluctant to share their teleportation circle codes.</span></p>
<br>
      <p><span><strong>Scrying</strong></span><span>: 1 hour ritual. 12 G or a 60 G crystal ball that is reusable. 2 Arcana checks vs the Will DC of the chosen creature (or DC 18 if a place is chosen). Choose a creature or place. If you have met the creature, know the creature's true name, or have been to the place you need only make 1 check. This ritual creates an invisible sensor somewhere nearby the creature/location. You can see through the sensor as if it were a window with a 360 degree view. The sensor also picks up and transmits sound as if your ear were in the place of the sensor. The sensor disappears after 10 minutes or you dismiss it as an action. If the creature or place does not exist or is on a different plane, or you critically fail one of the checks you can be shown something random and probably unhelpful/misleading.</span></p>
<br>
      <p><span><strong>Forbiddance</strong></span><span>: 4 hour ritual. 24 G. 2 DC 20 Arcana checks. Designate an area that fits within a 101' radius sphere. All Teleportation in and out of the area, Scrying within the area, and Divination effects to learn about the area are Counteracted using your Arcana modifier with Advantage.</span></p>
<br>
      <p><span><strong>Hex</strong></span><span>: 2 hour ritual. 6 G and a piece of the target creature's body. A drop of blood or single hair suffices. 2 Arcana checks vs the target's Will DC. The target creature becomes Hexed. This is a powerful curse that makes them Weak 1 to all damage, Doomed 1, and gives them Disadvantage on all skill checks using a chosen statistic.</span></p>
<br>
      <p><span><strong>Divine Guidance</strong></span><span>: 2 hour ritual. 12 G. 1 DC 20 Arcana check and 1 DC 20 Religious Lore check. You contact a deity and implore them to guide your path. You can tell the deity what you need guidance on by stating a goal you have that you need guidance to accomplish, but ultimately they will select a creature, object, or place they think you should visit. Normally it will help you towards your stated goal, but sometimes the deity will point you towards something totally unrelated if they think it will help you more or just want to prank you. You will know the rough direction of said creature, object, or place until you do or accomplish whatever the deity thought you should do or accomplish with the creature/object/place.</span></p>
<br>
      <p><span><strong>Mage's Tower</strong></span><span>: 6 hour ritual. 36 G. 2 DC 20 Arcana checks. You conjure a magical tower. The tower must fit within a 100' tall 30' radius cylinder, but its exact shape is up to you. The walls, floor, and interior of the tower are made of pure magical force, but come with illusions that make them look like whatever you decide. The tower is immune to all damage, but can be dispelled by powerful enough magic users. The tower can have doors and windows but lacks any fine details (like locks, or intricate artwork) and is totally unfurnished (no mattresses, sheets, pillows, cooking utensils, ect.).</span></p>

      <h3 id="ritleg"><span>Legendary</span></h3>
      <p><span>Tier 4 rituals are incredibly powerful but are very expensive and extremely difficult to perform correctly. Even the most powerful and learned magic users struggle to cast them.</span></p>
<br>
      <p><span><strong>Absorb Magic</strong></span><span>: 1 hour ritual. No cost. 1 DC 25 Arcana check. Can have any number of assistants, who each make 1 DC 20 spellcasting check. You and all assistants regain all lost focus points. Can use a diamond worth 100G, which halves the time of the ritual (the diamond isn't destroyed, it just helps the process of absorbing the magic). Can also use a permanent magic item, which also halves the time of the ritual but increases the DC of your check to the DC of the item (or 25, whichever is higher), increases the number of checks you have to make by 1, and increased the DC of the assistants' checks to 5 lower than the item's DC (or 20, whichever is higher). This disables the item for X hours, where X is the total number of focus points regained amongst you and the assistants.</span></p>
<br>
      <p><span><strong>Spell Immunity</strong></span><span>: 1 hour ritual. 32 G cost. 3 DC 25 Arcana checks. Can have 1 assistant, who makes 1 DC 20 spellcasting check. Name a spell. For the next 24 hours you or your assistant are completely immune to that spell. A creature can only be immune in this way to 1 spell at any given time. If you are already under the effect of the spell you are immune to its effects for 24 hours.</span></p>
<br>
      <p><span><strong>Raise Undead</strong></span><span>: 12 hour ritual. 100 G cost. 3 DC 25 Arcana checks. Can have any number of assistants, who must each make 1 DC 22 spellcasting check. Each corpse within 1 mile becomes animated a tier 0,1, or 2 Skeleton or Zombie depending on its level of decay and tier (tier 0 creatures become tier 0, tier 1 and 2 become tier 1, tier 3 and 4 become tier 2). They are not under anyone's control and will act completely of their own accord (which means they will attack the closest living creatures). However, the undead animated by this ritual view you and any of your assistants as allies and will not attack you nor your assistants.</span></p>
<br>
      <p><span><strong>Creation</strong></span><span>: 8 hour ritual. No cost. 3 DC 23 Arcana checks. Create 100 bulk of wood, stone, metal, water, or flesh. It appears out of nothing but is totally real.</span></p>
<br>
      <p><span><strong>Planar Binding</strong></span><span>: 6 hour ritual. 50 G cost. 3 DC 24 spellcasting checks. Choose a creature. That creature must remain within 30' of you throughout the ritual, and cannot change planes during the ritual as long as it is within 30' of you. At the end of the ritual that creature is bound to the current plane. It cannot use any form of planar travel while bound. Note summon spells tend to summon creatures from different planes, and when the summon spell ends the summoned creature returns to its native plane. So if you summon a creature, then bind it to the current lane it cannot return to its native plane and the summon spell can not end.</span></p>
<br>
      <p><span><strong>Curse of Death</strong></span><span>: 6 hour ritual. 80 G cost. 3 DC 26 Arcana or Occult Lore checks. Can have 1 assistant who must make 1 DC 26 spellcasting check. If you have an assistant you have advantage on your checks. At the end of the ritual speak a creature's ture name. That creature makes a fortitude save vs your Arcana or Occult Lore DC (whichever is higher). If they </span><span>Critically Succeed</span><span>: they are unaffected. </span><span>Succeed</span><span>&nbsp;they become Doomed 1. </span><span>Fail</span><span>: they become Doomed 2. </span><span>Critically Fail</span><span>: Doomed 3.</span></p>
<br>
      <p><span><strong>Globe of Invulnerability</strong></span><span>: 24 hour ritual. 120 G cost. 2 DC 30 Arcana checks. Can have 2 assistants who must each make 1 DC 25 spellcasting check. If you have 2 assistants you have advantage on your checks. Create a perfect sphere of any radius less than 1 mile centered on the square you are standing on when you finish the ritual. Nothing may enter or leave the sphere unless you make an exception for it during the ritual. For instance you could allow yourself and your assistants to enter and exit. You could also allow anyone who speaks a certain passphrase to enter or exit. You could allow air to come and go freely so anyone inside doesn't suffocate.</span></p>
<br>
      <p><span><strong>Resurrection</strong></span><span>: 6 hour ritual. 100 G cost. 3 DC 25 Arcana or Religious Lore checks. Choose a corpse you can touch throughout the ritual. If that corpse's soul is free and willing it is returned to the corpse and then the corpse is brought back to life. The body is also cured of all mortal wounds and any missing body parts are regrown. Can also be used on alive creatures to regrow missing body parts. This costs half as much and takes half as long.</span></p>
<br>
      <p><span><strong>True Polymorph</strong></span><span>: 4 hour ritual. 60 G cost. 3 DC 28 Arcana checks. Can have an assistant who doesn't need to make any checks and gives you Advantage on your checks. If you had an assistant that assistant is polymorphed into a creature of their choice. If you did not have an assistant you or a willing creature you touch is polymorphed instead. You can also select an unwilling creature but they get a Will save vs your Arcana DC to resist. Polymorphed means their physical statistics become those of the chosen creature. They lose all their class abilities, but gain any class abilities of the chosen creature. This polymorph lasts until dispelled, which can only be done by something like the Dispel Magic ritual.</span></p>
<br>
      <p><span><strong>Puppet</strong></span><span>: 12 hour ritual. 80 G cost and a puppet vaguely resembling the target creature that contains some part of the target's body (a drop of blood or single hair suffices). 3 Arcana checks vs the target's Will DC. If you do not know the target's true name your checks are made at Disadvantage. The target creature becomes linked to the puppet. Whenever the puppet moves, so too does the target creature. Whenever the puppet takes damage, so too does the target creature (puppet has AC 10). It takes an action to manipulate the puppet, which forces the target's body to also move in the same way.</span></p>
<br>
      <p><span><strong>Sphere of Annihilation</strong></span><span>: 24 hour ritual. 100 G cost. 2 DC 30 Arcana checks. Can have 2 assistants who must each make 1 DC 25 spellcasting check. If you have 2 assistants you have advantage on your checks. Create a perfect sphere of any radius less than 1 mile centered on the square you are standing on when you finish the ritual. Every living thing inside the sphere makes a Fortitude save vs your Arcana DC.
